<h1>Notes after the review of the Skins UK microsite</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Perhaps reconsider using uppercase for descriptions, since it can be a lot of information.</li>
	<li>Take away the hover text because it should be clear that the actual information is on a linked page, rather than the homepage.</li>
	<li>Consider using images from the generations as the buttons on the homepage â€“ it does not necessarily have to be single characters/the main characters.</li>
	<li>The pictures could be in color because that would counter the simplicity of the design nicely.</li>
