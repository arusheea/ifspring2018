		<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Arushee Agrawal<br>B.Sc. in Computer Science<br>Second Major in Design<br>Sophomore</li>
			<li>I enjoy product design and product development, with a specific interest in tech products. I thought this class would be a great way to introduce myself to formal design for interactive interfaces common in tech products.</li>
			<li>I have some experience with HTML and CSS in the past. I designed several pages while learning the two languages, including a replica of the www.bcc.com/news page. <br>I have limited experience with JavaScript from CSE 222 Internet of Things. <br>I am currently taking CSE 330 which also covers these three languages and more.</li>
			<li>I hope to learn the different ways to design interfaces based on the purpose and expected interaction, possibly involving real/hypothesized user research.</li>
			<li>I expect that designing for screens would require attention to interaction with the screen to access further information or options since we can now interact with screens in various ways, while on paper in most cases the ways of interacting with it are limited.</li>
			<li><a href="https://asoftmurmur.com/">A Soft Murmur</a><br>
			<ul>
				<li>The website provides a simple service and the design is kept simple to accompany that.</li>
				<li>The color scheme, font, and designed icons for different sounds are aesthetically cohesive.</li>
				<li>A Soft Murmur is meant to provide relaxing white noise, and it's design reflects this purpose in that it is not at all overwhelming or distracting.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><a href="https://www1.brain.fm/">Brain.fm</a><br>
			Being an upcoming start-up in AI and Music technology, Brain.fm has the difficult task of explaining what it does, selling its idea to all onlookers, and proving themselves reliable and desirable.
			<ul>
				<li>Given the amount of information Brain.fm needs to provide to create a complete picture of the company, I think they have great information architecture. The hierarchy is clear and sells their product well.</li>
				<li>Despite having a lot to convey, the page never appears too wordy and is easy to read.</li>
				<li>The clear subheadings and subtle design changes lead us through the home page easily helping us identify which section serves what purpose.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>
			<ul>
				<li>Trello's design isn't super fancy so it's easy to use without getting distracted which is essential for a task-organizing web app.</li>
				<li>The interaction with the interface is very easy too – almost everything involves click-and-drag or click-and-type to make changes to your task lists.</li>
			</ul></li>
