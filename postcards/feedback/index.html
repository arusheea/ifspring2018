		<ul>
			<li>In the first postcard, the text feels a bit light with the image you chose. Maybe consider a heavier font, or a light drop shadow (or even the gradient boxes/translucent boxes we talked about in class). I believe it wouldn't hurt the legibility of the quote to do that for any of your postcard designs.</li>
			<li>In the third postcard, I wonder how your text would move across the image as the window gets smaller, i.e. where would it be in the middle of the two sizes we designed for?</li>
			<li>Consider differentiating the name of the speaker from the quote in some way (size, opacity, color, font-weight, etc.)</li>
			<li>I'm unsure about how you would approach the careful aligning of your quote into the image in the first postcard's smaller size. I think this would be a technical challenge.</li>
			<li>Nitpicking: The image choices make sense mostly, especially for someone familiar with Avatar, but the third quote feels a bit out of place/not as connected to your image, if that is something you want to consider.</li>
