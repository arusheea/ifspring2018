			Give me a run for my money<br>
			There is nobody, no one to outrun me<br>

			So give me a run for my money<br>
			Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely<br>
			Just love me<br>
			(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br>
			Just love me, just love me, just love me<br>
			(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br>
			Love me<br>

			If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?<br>
			Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)<br>
			Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'<br>

			Hold up, we gon' function, no assumptions<br>
			Feelin' like Tyson with it<br>
			Knock it out twice, I'm with it<br>
			Only for the night, I'm kiddin'<br>
			Only for life, you're a homie for life<br>
			You're a homie for life, let's get it<br>
			Hit that shoulder lean<br>
			I know what comin' over mean<br>
			Backstroke oversea<br>
			I know what you need<br>
			Already on ten, our money come in<br>
			All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought<br>
			This party won't end<br>

			I'm on the way<br>
			We ain't got no time to waste<br>
			Poppin' your gum on the way<br>
			Am I in the way?<br>
			I don't wan' pressure you none<br>
			I want your blessing today<br>
			Oh, by the way, open the door by the way<br>
			Told you that I'm on the way<br>
			I'm on the way, I know connection is vague<br>
			Pick up the phone for me, babe<br>
			Damn it, we jammin'<br>
			Bad attitude from your nanny<br>
			Curves and your hips from your mammy<br>
			Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera<br>
			I know Top will be mad at me<br>
			I had to do it, I want your body, your music<br>
			I bought the big one to prove it<br>
			Look what you made<br>
			Told you that I'm on the way<br>
			I'm like an exit away, yep<br>
